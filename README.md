# textfsm playgorund

This playground is inspired by https://textfsm.nornir.tech/. This is something I have occasionally used to sanity check [TextFSM](https://github.com/google/textfsm/wiki/TextFSM) or [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) templates.

## Why?

- I wanted a nicer UI
- I wanted to ensure that anything I input was never leaving the browser and was always present on the client side.

## Supported Feature

- [x] TextFSM parsing
- [] JSON Schema Validation
